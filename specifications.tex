\section{Specifications}

\subsection{Endianness}

\subsubsection{Byte-Level}
\bus sends from Byte 0{\ldots}Byte N.

\subsubsection{Bit-Level}
\bus sends bytes most siginificant bit first (bit 31{\ldots}0).

\subsection{Retransmission}
There is no hardware re-transmission primative. The hardware provides a
transaction-level message acknowledgement, indicating whether the complete
message was received or not. Retransmission of failed messages is left to
software.

\subsection{Buffer Overflow / Flow Control}
There is no explicit flow control mechanism in \bus. If a receiving node does
not have a large enough buffer to handle the incoming message, it should not
acknowledge the message. A receiving node that overflows should issue a
Bus~Reset when the node overflows. This has two benefits: (i) it halts a
transmission as soon as it becomes evident that it will not succeed, (ii) it
hints to the transmitting node the approximate maximum buffer size of the
receiving node.
