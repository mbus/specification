\section{Power Design}
\label{sec:power}
The purpose of \bus is to support very low power operation. As such, it is
expected that systems leveraging \bus may need to support power-gating all or
part of the system. In this section, we discuss the requirements to support
power-gated systems, how such systems integrate with \bus, and how
power-oblivious chips can still interact with hyper power-conscious chips,
promoting interoperability.

\subsection{A Brief Background on Power-Gating}
