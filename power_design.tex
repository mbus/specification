\section{Power Design}
\label{sec:power}
The purpose of \bus is to support very low power operation. As such, it is
expected that systems leveraging \bus may need to support power-gating all or
part of the system. In this section, we discuss the requirements to support
power-gated systems, how such systems integrate with \bus, and how
power-oblivious chips can seamlessly interact with hyper power-conscious
chips, promoting interoperability.

\subsection{A Brief Background on Power-Gating}
In the low-power design space, a simple and important concept is the ability
to power-gate, or selectively disable, portions of a system that would
otherwise be idle. By power-gating---removing power from that section of a
chip---, the power consumption of idle silicon goes to zero.

Several challenges with power-gating include: how to preserve state during
idle windows, how to connect power-gated modules to other powered or
power-gated modules, and how to wake and sleep power-gated modules
deterministically. This document does not seek to address all these issues,

rather to demonstrate how \bus can help system designers and the signals that
are ``safe'' to utilize. For a more detailed reference power-gated design with
\bus, consult the {\em \bus~M3~Implementation~Specification}.

In general, sleeping and waking power-gated modules requires a series of
events to occur. In particular, the following signals define common power
control design:

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{r l l c c}
  Signal Name        & Function  & Power-Up & Power-Down \\
  \hline \hline
  {\tt POWER\_ON}    & Controls Power-Gating           & \nth{1} & \nth{2} \\
  {\tt RELEASE\_CLK} & Supply Clock to Internal Logic  & \nth{2} & \nth{2} \\
  {\tt RELEASE\_ISO} & Electrically Isolate Module I/O & \nth{3} & \nth{1} \\
  {\tt RELEASE\_RST} & (De)Assert Reset                & \nth{4} & \nth{2} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

For the purposes of this document, we are concerned with two modules: (i) The
block that interfaces with the bus itself---we define this as the {\tt Bus
Controller}---, and (ii) the node that is attached to the bus. With \bus, a
completely power-gated node can seamlessly awaken its {\tt Bus~Controller}
with no special assistance from the sending node or the master node. A {\tt
Bus~Controller} can filter addresses, only waking the entire node for a message
destined for that node. Additionally, a power-gated node with a simple
always-on low power interrupt generator can exploit \bus features to generate
the required edges with no specialization or externally synchronized knowledge
of chip status. Finally, devices can reliably detect a shutdown message sent
on the bus and use remaining control edges to shut down both the node and the
node's {\tt Bus~Controller}.

\subsection{Waking the \texttt{Bus~Controller}}
\label{sec:power-bus-controller-wakeup}
Referring to edges from \cref{fig:arbitration}, edges 1, 2, 3, and~4
provide the required signals. Mapping power edges to \bus protocol edges:

\begin{quote}
\begin{tabular}{r c l}
  Arbitration    & $\rightarrow$ & {\tt POWER\_ON} \\
  Priority Drive & $\rightarrow$ & {\tt RELEASE\_CLK} \\
  Priority Latch & $\rightarrow$ & {\tt RELEASE\_ISO} \\
  Drive Bit 0    & $\rightarrow$ & {\tt RELEASE\_RST} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

In practice, most {\tt Bus~Controller} implementations will not require the
{\tt RELEASE\_CLK} signal as the \bus clock is (by definition) sufficient for
all bus operations, however it is included in considerations for designs that
may require it. A {\tt Bus~Controller} that is awoken using \bus edges will
find its first rising clock edge to be Latch~Bit~0, the MSB of the address,
and should design state machines appropriately.

\subsubsection{Handling Interrupts During Wakeup}
\label{sec:power-bus-controller-wakeup-int}
By specification, Interrupts are not permitted during arbitration. If an
Interrupt occurred, an ignorant {\tt Bus~Controller} would hang, unable to
make forward progress as the remaining edges would have been driven from
clocking the control bits, causing the {\tt Bus~Controller} to interpret
either Latch Control Bit~0 or Latch Control Bit~1 as the MSB of the
destination address. After one or two more cycles, the bus would become idle
while the local {\tt Bus~Controller} waits indefinitely for more bits. This
condition would eventually resolve itself if any other node elected to send a
message but could not be resolved by any other means\footnote{
  Excepting things such as a local timeout and an external reset, but such
  a design is outside the scope of the discussion for a \bus member node.}.

As the {\tt Bus~Controller} was previously powered down, powering it down
again before releasing isolation is by definition a null operation. As
isolation is released on the final falling edge of arbitration and Interrupt
may only occur while the clock is high, a wake-up that is not Interrupted is
safe and canceling (re-power-gating) a wake-up that is Interrupted is safe.
The challenge is then that the sleep controller module that generates the
power control edges must also be capable of detecting an Interrupt. Whether
this level of robustness is required is left as an implementation decision.

\subsection{Waking the Node}
If the {\tt Bus~Controller}'s address matches the destination address, it must
wake whatever it is attached next up the chain, this means the clockless
{\tt Bus~Controller} module must harvest clock edges from \bus to generate the
power control signals.

One design point explicitly required by \bus is the acknowledgment of
zero-length messages. Depending on application, a node may not require
awakening for a zero-length message. Due to the nature of \bus Interrupt
procedure, however, as many as two bits may be received that will be discarded
(\cref{fig:interrupt}). A {\tt Bus~Controller} design that attempts to
minimize wakeups should therefore not begin the wakeup process until latching
the {\em \nth{3}} data bit.

\subsubsection{Handling Interrupts During Wakeup}
As the control bits provide ample edges, designers have more options for
handling interrupted wakeup. In particular, the same argument regarding wakeup
cancellation and arbitration from~\ref{sec:power-bus-controller-wakeup-int}
applies: if isolation has not been removed, the node may simply be
re-power-gated without issue.

A possibly simpler implementation can unconditionally complete the wakeup
sequence while indicating that a transaction was started, but failed.

Ultimately, the important consideration is to draw attention to the fact that
an Interrupt {\em may} occur during the {\tt Bus~Controller}'s issuing of
wakeup signals (at any point) and a robust {\tt Bus~Controller} implementation
must consider and handle the cases surrounding Interrupt.

\subsection{Waking via Local Interrupt}
It is also desirable for a clockless, power-gated \bus node to generate an
interrupt and send a message\footnote{
  As example, consider an ultrasonic transducer, which can be used as a near
  zero-energy wakeup source by harvesting energy from an ultrasonic wakeup
  chirp.}.
As the node now wishes to send a message, it cannot use the arbitration edges
as wakeup edges as it must be participating in the same arbitration to wake
itself up. Bus-level solutions, such as extra initial wakeup edges, require a
global sense of the current ``power-state'' of the bus as well as sacrificing
the ability of power conscious sensors to be used with power oblivious
designs.

Instead, power conscious nodes can exploit a robustness property of every \bus
master node to generate wakeup edges.
Section~\ref{sec:spec-spurious}~\nameref{sec:spec-spurious} defines master
node behavior in response to a glitch on the data line causing a spurious
wakeup. By deliberately inducing such a glitch, a power-gated member node can
generate enough pulses to wake itself up. \autoref{fig:induced-timing}
shows an example waveform of an induced glitch, annotated with power control
signals. \autoref{fig:induced-inducer} demonstrates a simple inducer
circuit.

Details on how the {\tt Bus~Controller} disambiguates between an RX-induced
wakeup and an interrupt requested wakeup and other implementation issues are
outside the scope of this document, but persons developing a power-gated
system are highly encouraged to read the {\em \bus M3 Implementation
Specification} as an example of how to design a power-gated system.

\subsection{Sleeping the {\tt Bus Controller}, Node}
\bus edges can also be harvested to return both the node and the bus
controller to sleep mode. While the exact message structure is left as
implementation defined, \autoref{fig:shutdown} demonstrates how the control
edges following the End~of~Message bit may be used to put both the node and
the {\tt Bus~Controller} to sleep.

\autoref{fig:shutdown} delays the shutdown procedure until the transmitter
asserts End~of~Message, indicating the shutdown message was not in error.
In addition, \autoref{fig:shutdown} has the advantage that a node transmitting
a shutdown request can itself shut down with no further intervention or
knowledge by the master node.

\subsection{The Master Node, In Brief}
Explicitly not discussed in this document is any indication of how a
power-gated master node is implemented. The period $t_{long}$ is permitted to
be arbitrary in length with the express intent of allowing sleeping master
nodes to wake themselves using the falling edge of {\tt DIN} as a trigger. The
actual means for waking the master node are outside the scope of this
document however.

Sleeping a master node is also outside the scope of \bus functionality.
A master node must sample its {\tt DIN} line upon returning to Idle (time~9
in \autoref{fig:shutdown}) by the rules laid out
in~\ref{sec:protocol-return-idle}~\nameref{sec:protocol-return-idle}. If the
{\tt DIN} line is high at that time after an implementation-defined shutdown
message, the master node may enter sleep.
