MBus Specification
==================

MBus is the next-generation interconnect that enables the millimeter-scale
computing class.

MBus is a chip-to-chip bus designed for ultra-constrained systems. MBus is a
multi-master bus supporting an arbitrary number of nodes, priority arbitration,
efficient acknowledgements, and extensible addressing, with only four wires and
consuming only 3.5 pJ/bit/chip.

MBus is _power-aware_, enabling the design of _power-oblivious_ systems.
Individual chips can fully power off and MBus will automatically take care of
all the tricky details.
