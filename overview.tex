\section*{Overview}
\bus is an ultra low power system bus. The original design was motivated by
the Michigan Micro Mote~(M3) project. The goal of \bus, however, is to be a
general purpose bus for hyper-constrained systems. \bus requires four pins per
node, uses purely digital logic, supports arbitrary length transfers, and
features a low-latency priority channel and robust acknowledgements. \bus
member nodes do not require a local clock and are capable of completely
stateless operation. \bus requires one more powerful node to act as a bus {\em
control} node, whose primary duties are providing the \bus clock and mediating
arbitration.
