\section*{Overview}
\bus is an ultra-low power system bus. The original design was motivated by
the Michigan Micro Mote~(M3) project. The goal of \bus, however, is to be a
general purpose bus for hyper-constrained systems. \bus requires four pins per
node, uses only push-pull logic, supports arbitrary length transfers, and
features a low-latency priority channel and robust acknowledgments. \bus
member nodes do not require a local clock and are capable of completely
clockless operation. \bus requires one more capable node to act as a bus {\em
mediator} node, whose primary duties are providing the \bus clock and
mediating arbitration.
