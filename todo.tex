\begin{description}
  \item[Maximum length?] \hfil \\
  Should there be some built-in (high, several~kB-MB) message length, just in
  case the controller happens to miss a Message~End~Sequence or something?
  (Answer: almost certainly yes). The real question: What is a reasonable such
  maximum?

  \item[Power-Gated Member Wake-up] \hfil \\
  Layers (member nodes) in the M3 system are all power gated, this means they
  require non-zero time to wake up and stabilize at the beginning of
  transmissions. In particular, this wakeup requires a few states:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Power on (remove power-gating)
    \item Warm up local oscillators
    \item De-assert Reset
    \item Remove isolation
  \end{itemize}
  In practice there are 4 states required in the most extreme to safely wake
  up a system. The TODO: Is this true in a general sense? If so, should waking
  nodes at the beginning of transmission be part of the protocol itself that's
  required or an unofficial M3 extension? See some of the more detailed
  current thoughts in~\ref{todo:wakeup}.
