\subsection{Future Extensions}
\label{sec:todo-extensions}
There are properties that would be nice to have, but introduce greater
complexity. While they are not in the current design, some methods for
designing them are considered here such that they are still feasible for
future implementation in a backwards-compatible manner.

\subsubsection{Automatically fragment long \proto messages}
Add a configuration register for a maximum message length, maybe one for each
message type, that limits maximum transaction length. Requests to send
messages over this length should be automatically fragmented by the sender.
