\subsection{Issues}
\begin{description}
	\item[CLK glitch] \hfil \\
	CLK glitch potentially causes a node driving the bus at {\sc latch state} or
	alternating {\sc drive1} and {\sc drive2}. The former may lead to improper
	reset some nodes if CLKs arrive differently. The latter may stall the entire
	transmission.

  \item[Varying edge latching?] \hfil \\
  How consistent are phase-offset nodes likely to be in latching previous
  versus new bus values, see:~\ref{todo:varying-latches}.

  \item[Maximum length?] \hfil \\
  Should there be some built-in (high, several~kB) message length, just in
  case the controller happens to miss a Message~End~Sequence or something?
  (Answer: almost certainly yes). The real question: What is a reasonable such
  maximum?
